# 📊 Student Performance Data Analysis Project

## 📁 Dataset Overview

This project analyzes a dataset containing student scores in four subjects (Maths, Science, English, History) along with their attendance records. The objective is to uncover patterns and insights that help understand student performance more effectively.

---

## ✅ Tasks Completed

- Cleaned and organized the raw dataset.
- Calculated summary statistics (mean, median, mode, min, max, standard deviation).
- Performed correlation analysis between subjects and attendance.
- Created histograms with frequency and bin values for each subject.
- Designed multiple charts for visual representation and dashboard.
- Compiled and explained key insights derived from data.

## 📊 Visualizations Used

- *Pie Chart*: Subject-wise contribution among 14 students.
- *Combo Chart (Cluster Column + Line)*: Maths vs Science comparison.
- *Box and Whisker Chart*: Score distribution across all subjects.
- *Bar Chart*: Average score per subject.
- *Line Chart*: Student performance trends across subjects.
- *Column Chart*: Subject-wise contribution comparison.

## 📌 Summary Statistics & Correlation

- Arranged together in a clean and well-formatted table in a dedicated sheet.
- Summary includes mean, median, mode, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation for all subjects and attendance.
- Correlation matrix shows relationships between each subject and attendance.

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Students with better attendance tend to score higher overall.
- A positive trend exists between attendance and History scores.
- English and History performance show some connection.
- Maths and Science have no significant correlation.
- Weak negative relationship observed between Maths and English performance.
